    about: 'Kombucha is a naturally fermented soda style drink made using tea as a main, filled with beneficial bacteria, supporting gut health, giving you a range of natural probiotics..

    about: 'Connection with producers is key, we generally source within Leinster. We process the vegetables just after they have been picked by the farmer to keep the most nutrients possible! The roots such as ginger and turmeric come from outside of Ireland. We use our skills and knowledge of the ancient techniques of fermentation to make our range of kraut, kimchi, vinegar and probiotic juices. The addition of foraged and other seasoning items make all the difference too. In order to reach a balanced and nutritious result, we choose to ferment for at least 6 months allowing a slow natural process to happen, using non-reactive stainless steel or glass vessels.',
